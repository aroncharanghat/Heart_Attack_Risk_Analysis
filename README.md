# Heart_Attack_Risk_Analysis
*Analyse health, lifestyle &amp; demographic factors influencing heart attack (CVD) risk using statistical and exploratory data analysis.*


## 🎯 Objective ##
The project examines the role of health, lifestyle, and demographic factors in determining heart attack (CVD) risk. It uses statistical and exploratory data analysis to detect key patterns, correlations, and high-risk indicators that can support early diagnosis and prevention strategies.

## 📊 Dataset Overview ##

* Source: Jamalpur Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh

* Duration: January 2024 – January 2025

* Total Records: 1,529 patient samples

* Scope: Comprehensive dataset including clinical, physical, and lifestyle parameters.

## 🧩 Key Features Analyzed ##

1. Demographics: Age, Sex

2. Body Metrics: Weight, Height, BMI, Abdominal Circumference, Waist-to-Height Ratio

3. Clinical Values: Blood Pressure (Systolic, Diastolic), Cholesterol (Total, HDL), Fasting Blood Sugar

4. Lifestyle Factors: Smoking Status, Physical Activity, Diabetes Status, Family History of CVD

5. Outcome Variable: CVD (Heart Attack) Risk Level

## 🔍 Analysis Insights (from the notebook content) ##

* Correlation studies reveal strong links between age, BMI, blood pressure, diabetes, and heart attack risk.

* Diabetes and hypertension notably increase the probability of higher CVD risk.

* Smoking and low physical activity are common among high-risk patients.

* BMI and abdominal circumference correlate with cholesterol imbalance, raising cardiovascular risk.

* Visualization techniques (heatmaps, bar charts, scatter plots) were used to explore relationships and detect patterns.

## 🧠 Conclusion ##

The study identifies that age, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, and smoking are major predictors of heart attack risk.
It emphasizes the importance of preventive care, lifestyle modification, and regular monitoring for individuals at risk.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques ##

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Correlation & Risk Visualization

## ✅ Recommendations ##

🥗 Promote healthy lifestyle habits — balanced diet, regular exercise, and maintaining ideal body weight to reduce obesity-related risks.

🚭 Discourage smoking and alcohol consumption — both are strongly linked to elevated CVD risk.

💉 Monitor key health indicators regularly — blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, and cholesterol levels for early detection of abnormalities.

🩺 Encourage routine medical check-ups — especially for individuals above 40 or those with a family history of heart disease.

❤️ Raise public awareness on the impact of diabetes, hypertension, and inactivity on cardiovascular health.

📈 Use predictive analytics tools to identify high-risk individuals and enable preventive healthcare interventions.
